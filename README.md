# carrotcore
A cobbled together custom worldgen datapack for carrot-craft.org that aims to improve playing experience for older clients (e.g. 1.8-1.12) on modern servers using ViaVersion. Clamps terrain to y=0-255 and makes it generally resemble pre-caves and cliffs while still incorporating modern structures and biomes. Great for use if you're running a modern server with a playerbase on legacy versions.

Credits to https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-generation-y and https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-more-copper-ore for some of the base. 

**REQUIRES RETRO CAVES TO WORK CORRECTLY https://modrinth.com/datapack/retro-caves!** 
Also recommend using https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-more-deepslate or a similar datapack to remove deepslate, as the default Viaversion mapping for it is garbage. If you use other datapacks along side this, you must set "ore-veins-enabled" to false in the overworld.json noise settings of each to completely remove copper ore if you desire to do so.
